%- what is the micro:bit?

The micro:bit is a small programmable and embeddable computer designed, 
developed and deployed by the BBC and partners (including ARM, Microsoft
and Lancaster University) to approximately 800,000 UK middle school students
in 2015-2016. Part of the BBC's Make it Digital Campaign, the BBC described the
micro:bit as its ``most ambitious education initiative in 30 years, 
with an ambition to inspire digital creativity and 
develop a new generation of tech pioneers.''~\cite{BBCwebsite}

Figure~\ref{fig:microbit} shows (a) the front and (b) the back of the
micro:bit, which measures 4cm x 5cm. Like the Arduino Uno, 
the micro:bit is a single-board microcontroller 
that can be programmed via a host computer (usually a laptop or desktop)
and then embedded in projects where it runs on battery power.
In contrast to the Uno, which has no built-in sensors, the micro:bit 
board hosts a variety of sensors (temperature, accelerometer, magnetometer, light level), 
a 5x5 LED matrix, two user-defined buttons, as well as Bluetooth
Low Energy (BLE) communications.\footnote{The micro:bit has a whopping
16kB of RAM and 256kB of Flash memory, compared to the Uno's 2kB of 
RAM and 32kB of Flash}.

The design of the micro:bit hardware was driven by the
first two objectives of the BBC micro:bit project:
(B1) to provide a simple creative experience for physical computing, wearable and Internet of Things (IoT) projects;
(B2) to supply a device that can continue to provide learning opportunities as the user's expertise grows.

On the hardware side, the micro:bit's built-in sensors, buttons and LED display 
allow many projects to be completed with no additional hardware or wiring. 
The holes on micro:bit's edge
connector allows additional external sensors and actuators to be connected via crocodile clips.
The micro:bit's BLE capabilities introduces networking to the
picture, and enables streaming of data and command/control operations among the micro:bit, 
smartphones, laptops, as well as other micro:bits.
As with Arduino, an ecosytem of micro:bit shields (that accommodate the micro:bit's edge
connector) expand its capabilities greatly.\footnote{

% micro:bit is an embeddable, reactive, networked computing system

The design of the micro:bit coding tools also was oriented towards a 
simple starting experience with room for progression. In particular, the coding 
objectives of the project were: (B3)
to give students an exciting, engaging introduction to coding;
(B4) to stimulate curiosity about how computing technologies can be utilized 
  to solve problems that students identify.

\end{figure*}

Based on user trials with a micro:bit prototype at Years 5 and 7 (3rd and 5th grade
in the US, respectively), the BBC focused on delivering a web app 
based on the popular Blockly framework~\cite{Blocky2015} to permit Year 7 students to
create scripts via drag-and-drop operations in a web browser, and see
the execution of their scripts via a simulator.
Text-based coding also was identified as an important feature.
As the micro:bit would be incorporated 
into standalone projects, it was essential for the user's program to be 
compiled and installed in non-volatile storage on the micro:bit where it 
could be run via battery power.

%final design put the entire toolchain in web app, without need to invoke C/C++ compiler to
%compile the user's program; ARM DAPlink solution makes micro:bit appear as USB pen drive
%on all operating systems; MicroPython provided second programming solution with entire toolchain
%on the micro:bit!!]

The solution delivered by the BBC's partners evolved from the initial
design to include:
\begin{itemize}
\item support for Blockly, JavaScript, Python and C++;
\item an efficient C++ runtime for the micro:bit created by Lancaster
University;
\item a web app (\url{http://makecode.microbit.org})
with Blockly and JavaScript editors, micro:bit simulator, 
and a compiler to machine code, linked against a pre-compiled C++ runtime;
\item an on-device compiler and read-eval-print loop (REPL) for Python 
(via \url{https://micropython.org/}, an implementation of Python 
for microcontrollers);
\item ARM's DAPlink firmware makes the micro:bit appear as USB pen drive 
on most operating systems, enabling a simple file copy operation to 
install a user's program on the micro:bit (no device drivers needed).
\end{itemize}
MakeCode, MicroPython, and the C++ runtime are all open source.\footnote{

\url{https://github.com/micropython/micropython},
and \url{https://github.com/lancaster-university/microbit-dal}, 
respectively.}

Figure~\ref{fig:snapshot} shows a screen snapshot of the MakeCode web app
for the micro:bit.

What happened in terms of deployment and experience:
\begin{itemize}
\item first full school year was 2016-2017, during which micro:bit Education Foundation got
started; 
\item two full school years complete with experience in more countries
\item approximately two million micro:bits in market;
\item lots of partners participating (ICSTE and CSTA 2018)!!
\end{itemize}

% from the BBC RFP

% Make it Digital is a BBC initiative to inspire a new generation to get creative with 
% coding, programming and digital technology. With a major focus in 2015, Make it Digital 
% will help all audiences see how Britain has helped shape the digital world, why digital 
% skills matter and their growing importance to our future. For younger audiences, Make it 
% Digital will help them discover the world of digital, see their creative potential in it 
% and inspire them to take their first steps in computational thinking and digital skills. 

% In September/October [2015], as part of the overall Make It Digital project, BBC Learning aims 
% to give away one million small, programmable, wearable devices. The device can be used 
% in classrooms and the home to create an engaging hands-­‐on learning experience that 
% allows any level of coder from absolute beginner to advanced maker to get involved and 
% be part of something exciting. Approximately 800,000 devices will go to every child in 
% the UK at Year 7 (tbc) and a further 200,000 will be made available to distribute 
% through competitions and other activities targeting other groups covering both children 
% and adults. 

% We anticipate that an online coding site will support the devices. The site will allow 
% owners to create programmes to run on their own devices and/or share programmes and code 
% with others.
