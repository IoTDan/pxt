% Sample file for 'CACM - Research Highlights'-type articles

%
% This is "research-highlights-sample.tex" (sample file) V1.1 Sept. 2008
% This file should be compiled with V1.1 of "research4cacm.cls" Sept. 2008
%
% If you have already submitted an article to an ACM/SIGS Conference, and have had your
% article published in one of the 'Proceedings', then you have probably used
% the (ACM/SIGS) 'sig-alternate' class and .tex file.
% Any such 'conference-prepared' source .tex file is 'compatible' with the class file
% 'research4cacm' which you will use to prepare your article for inclusion in the magazine 'CACM'.
%
% Here are the steps to take in order to 'morph' your article from being
% a 'conference' article to one more suitable for inclusion in 'Communications of the ACM'.
%
% 1. Change \documentclass{sig-alternate}  to \documentclass{research4cacm}
%
% 2. Comment out the conference information e.g.  %\conferenceinfo{WOODSTOCK}{'97 El Paso, Texas USA}
%
% 3. Make sure the copyright data is correct e.g. \crdata{0001-0782/08/0200}
%
% 4. Make sure the YEAR is correct e.g. \CopyrightYear{2008} with the current default being �2008�.
%
% 5. Comment out the Classification scheme, general terms and keywords.
%
% 6. If you have mentioned authors in the 'Additional Authors' section you should
%    'move them back' into the byline (so that they appear with all the other authors).
%    ALL authors, in Research Highlights articles, get equal billing.
%
% 7. Suitably edit the file (i.e. body text) so as to make it more appropriate for a wider audience.
%
% If, early on in the editorial process, the 'correct' copyright data becomes available
% please change the copyright data to suit, otherwise leave the default '0001-0782/08/0X00'.
% (The editorial staff will change it later on in the production cycle.)

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations.
%
\numberofauthors{3} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of SIX authors and all of them fit neatly on the first page.
% As said, all authors get 'equal billing' and you should fit all of them on the opening page
% in the 'byline'. The production/editorial-staff will 'separate' names from their affiliations, leaving
% author names beneath the title (in the byline), and moving the affilations/contact information to an area
% after the references at the back of the article.
%
\author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.
