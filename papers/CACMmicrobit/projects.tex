\label{sec:}

In this section we present a sampling of projects that 
illustrate the capabilities of the micro:bit. 

\subsection{Wearables: Dance}

\subsection{Embed for STEM}

% Bloodhound rocket car:

%
% The Micro:bitâ€™s are used to capture the telemetry data X,Y,Z movement
% and acceleration from the rocket car. Students simply fit a Micro:bit into the Rocket car, 
% the Micro:bit is secured within a custom case, which protect the Micro:bit. In association 
% with Kitronik we have developed set of IRDA timing gates, these have been built to time the 
% cars over a fixed 1m distance allowing students to measure the speed of their cars accurately 
% during race conditions.
