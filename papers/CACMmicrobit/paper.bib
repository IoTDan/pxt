% from Steve and Sue:
% Ben-Ari’s constructivist learning theory suggests that knowledge is actively constructed
% by the student [3]. Papert built on the constructivist concept by introducing the term
% ‘constructionism’ [12] to indicate a combination of constructivism and hands-on construction.
% He argues that learning happens most readily in a context where the learner is consciously
% engaged in constructing a real, visible thing

% Typescript extends JavaScript with optional type annotations that are, by design, unsound and, that the Typescript compiler
% discards as it emits code. This design point preserves programming idioms developers are familiar with, and allows them to leave
% their legacy code unchanged, while offering a measure of static error checking in parts of the program that have type
% annotations.
% We present an alternative design for TypeScript, one where it is possible to support
% the same degree of dynamism, but where types can be strengthened to provide hard guarantees.
% We report on an implementation, called StrongScript, that
% improves runtime performance of typed programs
% when run on a modified version of the V8 JavaScript engine.
