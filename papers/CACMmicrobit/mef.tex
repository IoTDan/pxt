% \label{sec:mef}

% In December 2014, the BBC issued an Request for Participation
% for ``Delivery of a hands-on learning experience for the Make it Digital season'',
% which was the micro:bit project.
% Twenty-nine partners were invited to contribute hardware, software, services, 
% teaching materials, packing/distribution, logistics, events and funding.
% Work on the project commenced in February 2015, with delivery of
% a web site/app in September 2015 (which was critical
% for training teachers) and delivery of the micro:bits in the second
% half of the 2015-2016 school year.
