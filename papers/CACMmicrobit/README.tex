The micro:bit is a small programmable and embeddable computer designed, 
developed and deployed by the BBC and 29 partners (including ARM, Microsoft, 
and Lancaster University) to approximately 800,000 UK middle school students
in 2015-2016. Part of the BBC´s Make it Digital Campaign, the BBC described the
micro:bit as its ``most ambitious education initiative in 30 years, 
with an ambition to inspire digital creativity and 
deve lop a new generation of tech pioneers.''~\cite{BBCwebsite}

% reference the competition and show what's different (hardware)

Figure~\ref{micro:bit} shows a picture of the front and back of the
micro:bit, which measures 4x5 centimeters. Like the Arduino Uno,
the micro:bit is a single-board microcontroller that can be embedded
in projects where it runs on battery power.
In contrast to the Uno, which requires wiring of sensors and actuators
to the board, the micro:bit board hosts a variety of
sensors (temperature, accelerometer, compass, light level), a
5x5 LED matrix, two user-defined buttons, as well as Bluetooth
Low Energy (BLE) antenna, a USB pen drive interface, and an edge connector.

The design of the micro:bit hardware was driven by the
first two objectives of the micro:bit project, which were to:
\begin{itemize}
\item provide a simple creative experience for physical computing and embeddable/wearable projects, yet
\item supply a device that is sufficiently capable to grow with the user’s experience; 
\end{itemize}

On the hardware side, the micro:bit's built-in sensors and outputs allow many projects to 
be completed with just the micro:bit. The holes on micro:bit's edge
connector allows additional external sensors and actuators to be connected via crocodile clips.
As with Arduino, an ecosytem of micro:bit shields that the micro:bit can plug into expand
its capabilities greatly. The micro:bit's BLE capabilities introduces networking to the
picture, and enables streaming of data and command/control operations among the micro:bit, 
smartphones, laptops, as well as other micro:bits.

The design of the micro:bit software was also oriented towards a simple starting experience
with room for progression. In particular, the coding objectives of the project were to:
were:
\begin{itemize}
  \item give students an exciting, engaging introduction to coding;
  \item stimulate curiosity about how computing technologies can be utilized 
  to solve problems that students identify. 
\end{itemize}

%- deliver end-to-end experience
%   - hardware (unique design)
%   - firmware
%   - web-based IDE
%   - content
%   - training
%- Transition to non-profit foundation (end of 2016-)
%- expand from UK to worldwide

% - why is it interesting?
%   - edge/physical/IoT computing
%   - build off of Scratch/Blockly, but untethered (via in-browser compiler)
%   - transition to JavaScript and Python

% - BBC rollout in UK
% - Global reach
%    - BBC rollout mirrored in other countries
%    - Communities
%      - Sri Lanka user group: http://microbitslug.org/
%      - UK libraries (loan program)
%    - third party editors

% Design considerations (technical requirements, steal from LCTES paper)

%   - hardware clearly distinguished from Arduino
%     - no wiring required to do interesting things (integrated sensors and outputs, etc.)
%     - device appears as USB pen drive (drag-and-drop programming)
 
%   - As with Arduino, embedding device into projects is essential (from beginner to maker)
%     - battery power
%     - works disconnected from host
%     - wearable, transportable
%     - low cost
%     - edge connector for easy connection to "shields"

%   - support for scripting languages (JavaScript and Python; no C/C++ for beginners)
%     - event-based programming model

%   - web-based IDE
%     - no apps or device drivers to install
%     - school considerations (minimize IT admin involvement)

%   - layered approach
%     - simple for absolute beginners to get started
%     - room for students to advance to more complex projects

% - worldwide rollout
%   - microbit.org, makecode.microbit.org

% 2.3.4 Contributed Articles
% Contributed Articles cover the wide and abundant spectrum of the computing field—its open challenges, 
% technical visions and perspectives, educational aspects, societal impact, significant applications and 
% research results of high significance and broad interest. 

% we have:
% + technical vision
% + educational aspect and societal impact
% + signification application
% - research results of high significance and broad interest: see LCTES 2018 article

% Topics covered must reach out to a very broad technical audience.
% Articles in Communications should be aimed at the broad computing and information technology community.

% A Contributed Article should set the background and provide introductory references, 

% define fundamental concepts, 

% compare alternate approaches, 

% Arduino
% Scratch (tethered)
% MicroPython

% and explain the significance or application of a particular technology 

% or result by means of well-reasoned text and pertinent graphical material. 

% The use of sidebars to illustrate significant points is encouraged.

% Full-length Contributed Articles should consist of up to 4,000 words, 
% contain no more than 25 references, 3-4 tables, 3-4 figures, 
% and be submitted to: http://cacm.acm.org/submissions.

% Submissions to the Contributed Articles section should be accompanied by a cover letter indicating:
% • Title and the central theme of the article; 
% • Statement addressing why the material is important to the computing field and of value to the Communications reader;
% • Names and email addresses of three or more recognized experts who would be considered appropriate to review the submission.


% from the BBC RFP

% Make it Digital is a BBC initiative to inspire a new generation to get creative with 
% coding, programming and digital technology. With a major focus in 2015, Make it Digital 
% will help all audiences see how Britain has helped shape the digital world, why digital 
% skills matter and their growing importance to our future. For younger audiences, Make it 
% Digital will help them discover the world of digital, see their creative potential in it 
% and inspire them to take their first steps in computational thinking and digital skills. 

% In September/October [2015], as part of the overall Make It Digital project, BBC Learning aims 
% to give away one million small, programmable, wearable devices. The device can be used 
% in classrooms and the home to create an engaging hands-­‐on learning experience that 
% allows any level of coder from absolute beginner to advanced maker to get involved and 
% be part of something exciting. Approximately 800,000 devices will go to every child in 
% the UK at Year 7 (tbc) and a further 200,000 will be made available to distribute 
% through competitions and other activities targeting other groups covering both children 
% and adults. 

% We anticipate that an online coding site will support the devices. The site will allow 
% owners to create programmes to run on their own devices and/or share programmes and code 
% with others.
