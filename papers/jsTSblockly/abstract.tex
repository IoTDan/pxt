    While there are many JavaScript libraries for building solutions for a 
    wide range of problems, it's not easy for novices to harness their power.  
    We show how TypeScript, a gradually typed superset of JavaScript, can be used
    to bridge the jap between JavaScript and Blockly, a framework for creating
    block-based programming environments that
    greatly reduces the potential for syntax and semantic errors. 
    In particular, we define a mapping from TypeScript to 
    Blockly that makes it simple
    to create a domain-specific Blockly editor for a JavaScript library via a 
    TypeScript declaration file.  This mapping is support by the \MC
    framework (\url{www.makecode.com}).
